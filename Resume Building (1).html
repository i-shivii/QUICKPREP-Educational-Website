        <h2>Choose an ATS-Friendly Resume Template:</h2>

            <li>Use standard fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman. The ATS may have difficulty parsing unusual fonts.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Content and Structure:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with a clear and concise summary or objective statement at the top of your resume. This should highlight your career goals and what you bring to the role.</li>
            <li>Organize your resume into distinct sections: Contact Information, Summary/Objective, Skills, Professional Experience, Education, Certifications, Projects, and any other relevant sections.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Optimize Your Resume with Keywords:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use relevant keywords and phrases throughout your resume. These should align with the job description and the specific skills and qualifications the company is looking for.</li>
            <li>Include technical skills, programming languages, tools, and technologies you are proficient in.</li>
            <li>Tailor your resume for each application by customizing the keywords based on the specific job requirements.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Prioritize Information:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Highlight the most relevant information near the top of your resume. This includes your skills, recent work experience, and achievements.</li>
            <li>Use bullet points to list your responsibilities and accomplishments. Start each bullet point with a strong action verb.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Quantify Achievements:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Whenever possible, provide quantifiable data to illustrate your achievements. For example, "Implemented a system that reduced server response time by 20%."</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Test Your Resume Using Free Tools:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilize online ATS resume checker tools to ensure your resume is ATS-friendly. These tools analyze your resume's compatibility with applicant tracking systems.</li>
            <li>Examples of free ATS resume checker tools include Jobscan, Resunate, and RezScore. These tools provide feedback and suggestions for improving your resume's ATS compatibility.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Review and Proofread:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Carefully review your resume to check for any spelling or grammatical errors.</li>
            <li>Seek feedback from peers, mentors, or professional resume services to ensure your resume is clear, concise, and effectively communicates your qualifications.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Customize for Each Application:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Customize your resume for each job application. Tailor it to match the specific job requirements and company values.</li>
        </ul>
    
         

    <h2>Do's:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Use Microsoft Word or Google Docs:</h3> Create and edit your resume using Microsoft Word or Google Docs. These platforms are ATS-friendly and offer standard formatting options.</li>
        <li><h3>Submit as a PDF:</h3> Save and submit your final resume as a PDF file. PDFs preserve formatting, and they are easily readable by ATS tools. However, always create your resume in Microsoft Word or Google Docs first.</li>
        <li><h3>Use Common Resume Formats:</h3> Stick to common and straightforward resume formats. ATS tools are designed to read and parse standard formats effectively.</li>
        <li><h3>Narrow Margins:</h3> Reduce the margins of your resume to maximize space. A margin of 0.5 inches on each side is sufficient and helps fit more content on the page.</li>
        <li><h3>Standard Fonts:</h3> Use standard and easily readable fonts such as Arial, Calibri, or Garamond. Avoid using new or decorative fonts that may not be recognized by ATS.</li>
        <li><h3>Readable Font Size:</h3> Maintain a minimum font size of 10px for readability. This ensures that your resume is legible for both ATS tools and human readers.</li>
        <li><h3>Standard Sections and Headings:</h3> Structure your resume with standard sections and headings. Common sections include Contact Information, Summary/Objective, Skills, Professional Experience, Education, Certifications, and Projects. Using recognized headings helps ATS tools identify and parse information accurately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Don'ts:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Avoid Graphic Design Tools:</h3> Do not use graphic design software like Photoshop or online resume builders to create your resume. ATS tools may have difficulty reading content created in such tools.</li>
        <li><h3>Minimize Header and Footer Usage:</h3> Avoid using the header and footer sections in a Word or Google Docs file. Instead, reduce margins and include all necessary information in the body of the document. Headers and footers can be problematic for ATS tools.</li>
        <li><h3>Steer Clear of Uncommon Fonts:</h3> Do not use uncommon or decorative fonts that may convert letters into special characters, making the text unreadable to ATS tools.</li>
    </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>List Your Key Selling Points: Begin by listing your most important qualifications, experiences, and skills that align with the job descriptions you are targeting.</li>
            <li>Concise Summary: Summarize these selling points into a brief, well-crafted summary that is typically under 50 words. This should quickly convey why you are a strong fit for the job.</li>
            <li>Address the Why: Clearly state why you are an ideal candidate for the position. Highlight your unique skills or experiences that make you stand out.</li>
            <li>Use Active Language: Write your summary in an active voice using action words. This creates a sense of energy and engagement in your summary.</li>

            <li>Create a Headline: Instead of labeling the section as "Professional Summary," craft a more concise and descriptive headline, typically under 10 words.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>Here are some examples of effective headlines for your resume summary:</p>

        </ol>
    
        <p>Use "|" or tabs to separate this information as needed.</p>
    
        <h2>Skills:</h2>
        <p>In the skills section, highlight your technical capabilities effectively. Organize your skills like this:</p>
        <p><strong>Skill Summary:</strong> A brief overview or category of your skills.</p>
        <p><strong>List of Skills:</strong> Include your programming languages and tech stacks. You can indicate your familiarity or proficiency level, such as "Over 10,000 lines" for programming languages.</p>

            Frameworks: React | Angular | Django
            Databases: MySQL | MongoDB | PostgreSQL
        </pre>

    <title>Resume Optimization</title>

    <h1>Optimize your resume with keywords</h1>
    <h2>Must-haves to optimize your content:</h2>
    <h3>Do's</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Highlighting a few of your best achievements is better than including many "average" achievements in your resume</li>
        <li>Use only 1 page for your resume</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Don'ts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not list all your achievements just to showcase a greater quantity without filtering</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Keyword optimization</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are a hiring manager or recruiter screening a resume while juggling many other tasks in your job - you simply won't have much time on each resume! When a hiring manager looks at a resume, they are in fact quickly scanning for keywords of skills or experiences that they value, before paying any additional attention to your resume.</p>
    <p>Recruiters and ATS do that as well, but based on the job description that the hiring manager helped to write. That is why optimizing your resume based on job descriptions is very important.</p>
    <h3>INFO</h3>
    <p>Some ATS will determine the strength of your skills based on the frequency of a keyword in your resume, and others assign an estimated amount of experience for a skill based on its placement in your resume.</p>
    <p>For instance, if your previous job experience was 3 years long and you mentioned handling Search engine marketing (SEM), the ATS will assume 5 years of SEM experience.</p>
    <p>Include keywords from job descriptions into your resume</p>
    <p>You should always analyze the job description for must-have and good-to-have skills or experiences and ensure the keywords are added to your resume.</p>
    <p>Include them under the "Skills" section and pepper the same keywords into the "Work Experience" and "Education" sections. Be sure to closely imitate the language within the job description.</p>
    <p>Remember to include the full version of common abbreviations as well. E.g. Amazon Web Services instead of AWS, Google Cloud Platform instead of GCP.</p>
    <p>However, do not do keyword stuffing for the sake of it - always remember that the resume will be read by a recruiter or hiring manager eventually.</p>
    <h2>Optimize keyword frequency and placement</h2>
    <p>Analyze the job description and determine how important each skill and experience is, then optimize the frequency of the keyword according to its importance.</p>
