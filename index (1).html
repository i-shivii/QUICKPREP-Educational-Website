                <p>"Hello, I am Priyal Baghel, and I have successfully completed my Bachelor of Technology in
                    Information Technology from the Oriental Institute Of Science And Technology, Bhopal, spanning
                    from 2019 to 2023. This institution provided me with a nurturing environment to cultivate my
                    passion for innovation and technology.

                    I am delighted to share that I have secured a position at DXC Technology, marking an exciting

                    Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in a wide range of technical subjects,
                    including C, C++, Java, DBMS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allowed me to develop strong
                    problem-solving skills. Additionally, I actively participated in extracurricular activities,

                <p> I completed my graduation from Oriental institute of science and technology bhopal in IT branch
                    in 2023 .In the beginning, my programming knowledge was limited to basic C++ and SQL. By my
                    second year of college, I lacked certifications, skills, and significant projects. Determined to
                    improve my prospects, I focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and practiced with
                    friends. I realized that the choice of programming language was flexible and chose to specialize
                    in C++ for its effectiveness in DSA. I also focused on mastering core concepts, including
                    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), languages, Database Management Systems (DBMS), and SQL. I
                    dedicated time to improving aptitude and reasoning skills alongside technical knowledge.

                    During college, I worked on projects related to AI, OpenCV, RFID door locks, and web
                    development, securing a paid internship through Internshala. With a strong foundation, I
                    confidently faced technical interview rounds, which often revolved around coding, OOP, SQL, and
                    puzzles. Support from friends, seniors, and online resources played a crucial role.
                    Communication skills were important, but clarity in expressing ideas was more vital than
                    language proficiency.

                <p>" I am Shivam Mishra, a final year undergraduate at Oriental University. My journey so far has
                    been enriched with valuable experiences and contributions. During my internship at the M.P.
                    Police Cyber Cell from May 2022 to December 2022 in Bhopal, I delved into the world of
                    cybersecurity. I had the opportunity to study live cases, gaining practical insights into
                    real-world cyber threats. My time there also allowed me to understand the intricate workings of
                    the State Command Center and learn about the prevention measures against various types of
                    cybercrimes.

                    In addition to my internship, I proudly serve as a Core Team Member at the Google Developer
                    Group Cloud Bhopal since June 2022. In this role, I've organized and successfully executed Cloud
                    Community Day events in both 2022 and 2023. These events brought together a diverse and engaged
                    community, with over 600 enthusiastic attendees. I've also taken on the responsibility of
                    managing a vibrant community of more than 2100 members, fostering collaboration and
                    knowledge-sharing within the cloud computing domain.

                    These experiences have not only expanded my knowledge but also honed my skills in cybersecurity
                    and community management. I look forward to continuing my journey ."</p></p>
